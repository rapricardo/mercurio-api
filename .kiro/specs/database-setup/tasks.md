### Database Schema Summary
- **11 tables** implementing complete multi-tenant analytics platform
- **Core tenancy**: tenant, workspace, api_key
- **Identity system**: visitor, lead, identity_link (with PII encryption)
- **Event tracking**: session, event (with JSONB for flexible data)
- **Funnel analytics**: funnel, funnel_version, funnel_publication, funnel_step, funnel_step_match
- **22 optimized indexes** for multi-tenant query patterns
- **Foreign key constraints** with proper cascade relationships

### Ready for Development
