# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Event Ingestion API is a core component of the Mercurio analytics platform that enables clients to send tracking events, user identification data, and behavioral analytics data to the system. This API serves as the primary entry point for all event data collection, supporting both real-time single events and batch processing capabilities. The system must handle high-volume event ingestion while maintaining data integrity, security, and multi-tenant isolation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with Mercurio, I want to send individual tracking events via a REST API, so that I can capture user interactions in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client sends a POST request to `/v1/events/track` with valid event data THEN the system SHALL accept the event and return a 200 status code
2. WHEN the event data includes required fields (event_name, timestamp, visitor_id) THEN the system SHALL process and store the event
3. WHEN the event data is missing required fields THEN the system SHALL return a 400 error with specific validation messages
4. WHEN the API key is valid and associated with a tenant THEN the system SHALL associate the event with the correct tenant
5. IF the request payload exceeds 1MB THEN the system SHALL reject the request with a 413 error

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer with high-volume event data, I want to send multiple events in a single request, so that I can reduce network overhead and improve performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client sends a POST request to `/v1/events/batch` with an array of events THEN the system SHALL process all valid events
2. WHEN the batch contains both valid and invalid events THEN the system SHALL process valid events and return detailed error information for invalid ones
3. WHEN a batch contains more than 1000 events THEN the system SHALL reject the request with a 400 error
4. WHEN batch processing is successful THEN the system SHALL return a summary of processed and failed events
5. IF any event in the batch fails validation THEN the system SHALL continue processing remaining events

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer implementing user tracking, I want to identify users and associate them with their events, so that I can build comprehensive user profiles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client sends a POST request to `/v1/events/identify` with user identification data THEN the system SHALL create or update the user profile
2. WHEN the identify call includes a visitor_id and user_id THEN the system SHALL link the anonymous visitor to the identified user
3. WHEN user traits are provided THEN the system SHALL store and update the user profile with the new traits
4. WHEN an identify call is made for an existing user THEN the system SHALL merge new traits with existing ones
5. IF the user_id is already associated with a different visitor_id THEN the system SHALL handle the identity resolution appropriately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want API key-based authentication for event ingestion, so that I can control access and ensure data security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request is made without an API key THEN the system SHALL return a 401 unauthorized error
2. WHEN a request is made with an invalid API key THEN the system SHALL return a 401 unauthorized error
3. WHEN a request is made with a valid API key THEN the system SHALL identify the associated tenant and process the request
4. WHEN an API key is revoked THEN the system SHALL immediately reject requests using that key
5. IF rate limits are exceeded for an API key THEN the system SHALL return a 429 error with retry information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want all ingested events to be validated and enriched with metadata, so that I can ensure data quality and consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an event is received THEN the system SHALL validate it against the defined schema
2. WHEN an event passes validation THEN the system SHALL enrich it with server-side metadata (received_at, ip_address, user_agent)
3. WHEN an event contains a timestamp THEN the system SHALL validate it is within acceptable time bounds (not too far in past/future)
4. WHEN event properties contain potentially harmful data THEN the system SHALL sanitize the input
5. IF an event fails schema validation THEN the system SHALL return specific error messages indicating which fields are invalid

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want visitor and session tracking capabilities, so that I can understand user behavior across multiple interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an event is received with a visitor_id THEN the system SHALL associate it with the correct visitor record
2. WHEN a new visitor_id is encountered THEN the system SHALL create a new visitor record with initial metadata
3. WHEN events from the same visitor occur within a session timeout period THEN the system SHALL group them into the same session
4. WHEN a session expires due to inactivity THEN the system SHALL create a new session for subsequent events from that visitor
5. IF session data becomes corrupted THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the error and create a new session

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive error handling and monitoring, so that I can maintain system reliability and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any error occurs during event processing THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN the system is under high load THEN it SHALL implement backpressure mechanisms to prevent data loss
3. WHEN database connections fail THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
4. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL alert monitoring systems
5. IF the system cannot process events temporarily THEN it SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes with retry guidance

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want a JavaScript SDK for easy integration, so that I can quickly implement event tracking without handling HTTP requests manually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the SDK is initialized with an API key THEN it SHALL configure itself for the correct tenant
2. WHEN track() is called with event data THEN the SDK SHALL send the event to the ingestion API
3. WHEN identify() is called with user data THEN the SDK SHALL send identification data to the API
4. WHEN the SDK is used in a browser environment THEN it SHALL handle CORS and network errors gracefully
5. IF the network is unavailable THEN the SDK SHALL queue events and retry when connectivity is restored

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive observability and metrics, so that I can monitor system health and business performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN events are processed THEN the system SHALL emit metrics for throughput, latency, and error rates
2. WHEN requests flow through the system THEN distributed tracing SHALL provide end-to-end visibility
3. WHEN business events occur THEN the system SHALL track tenant-level metrics (events/tenant, conversion rates)
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide contextual logging with trace correlation
5. IF system performance degrades THEN monitoring alerts SHALL trigger automatically

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want event schema versioning support, so that I can evolve my event structure without breaking existing integrations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN events are sent with a schema version header THEN the system SHALL validate against the correct schema
2. WHEN older schema versions are used THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility
3. WHEN schema migrations are needed THEN the system SHALL provide clear migration guidance
4. WHEN unsupported schema versions are used THEN the system SHALL return specific version error messages
5. IF schema conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed validation feedback

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want enriched geolocation and device data, so that I can perform detailed user behavior analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN events are received THEN the system SHALL enrich them with accurate geolocation data from IP address
2. WHEN user-agent data is available THEN the system SHALL parse and extract device, OS, and browser information
3. WHEN UTM parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL validate and standardize campaign tracking data
4. WHEN enrichment fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle errors without blocking event processing
5. IF geolocation data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL still process events with partial metadata
