# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements comprehensive security hardening and production observability capabilities for the analytics platform. The scope includes PII encryption, rate limiting, API key caching, distributed tracing, metrics collection, and data quality monitoring to ensure secure, observable, and reliable operations in production environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want PII data to be encrypted at rest, so that sensitive user information is protected from unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an email address is stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt it using AES-GCM and store it in the email_enc field
2. WHEN a phone number is stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt it using AES-GCM and store it in the phone_enc field
3. WHEN generating user fingerprints THEN the system SHALL use HMAC-SHA256 with a rotatable secret from environment variables
4. IF KEK/DEK architecture is applicable THEN the system SHALL migrate to store key encryption keys and data encryption keys
5. WHEN encryption keys need rotation THEN the system SHALL support key rotation without data loss

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want rate limiting per tenant/workspace, so that no single tenant can overwhelm the system resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tenant makes API requests THEN the system SHALL apply rate limiting using token bucket algorithm
2. WHEN Redis is available THEN the system SHALL use Redis for distributed rate limiting
3. WHEN Redis is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fallback to in-memory rate limiting with conservative limits
4. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP 429 responses
5. WHEN rate limiting is active THEN the system SHALL track rate limit hits in metrics

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want API key validation to be cached, so that authentication performance is optimized without compromising security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API key is validated THEN the system SHALL cache the validation result with a 60-second TTL
2. WHEN a cached API key validation exists THEN the system SHALL use the cached result instead of re-validating
3. WHEN the cache TTL expires THEN the system SHALL re-validate the API key
4. WHEN an API key is revoked THEN the system SHALL invalidate the cache entry immediately
5. WHEN cache is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fallback to direct validation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want distributed tracing and metrics collection, so that I can monitor system performance and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL generate OpenTelemetry traces with unique trace IDs
2. WHEN collecting metrics THEN the system SHALL expose Prometheus-compatible metrics for throughput, latency, and errors
3. WHEN logging events THEN the system SHALL include trace IDs in all log entries
4. WHEN sampling traces THEN the system SHALL use configurable sampling rates (1-5% initially)
5. WHEN metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL track rate limit hits and PII encryption operations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want data quality monitoring, so that I can track and improve event processing reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN events are rejected THEN the system SHALL increment counters categorized by rejection reason
2. WHEN events are discarded THEN the system SHALL sample and log discarded events for analysis
3. WHEN data quality issues occur THEN the system SHALL expose metrics for monitoring dashboards
4. WHEN processing events THEN the system SHALL track validation failure rates
5. WHEN events fail processing THEN the system SHALL categorize and count error types

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want monitoring dashboards and alerts, so that I can proactively manage system health and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL provide initial Grafana dashboards for key metrics
2. WHEN latency exceeds thresholds THEN the system SHALL trigger alerts for p95 > 120ms
3. WHEN error rates increase THEN the system SHALL trigger alerts for 5xx responses
4. WHEN rate limiting activates THEN the system SHALL trigger alerts for excessive rate limit hits
5. WHEN system health degrades THEN the system SHALL provide actionable alert information

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want secure secrets management and rotation procedures, so that cryptographic keys and sensitive configuration can be managed safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the system THEN all secrets SHALL be managed through environment variables
2. WHEN documenting security procedures THEN the system SHALL provide key rotation guidelines in docs/guidelines/security-privacy.md
3. WHEN rotating secrets THEN the system SHALL support rotation via keyVersion with documented zero-downtime runbook
4. WHEN storing secrets THEN the system SHALL never log or expose secrets in plain text
5. WHEN configuring encryption THEN the system SHALL use separate keys for different data types

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want performance targets to be met under production load, so that the system provides reliable service to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing moderate volume THEN the system SHALL maintain p95 latency < 120ms
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL classify and categorize all error types
3. WHEN rate limiting is active THEN the system SHALL enforce limits per tenant without affecting other tenants
4. WHEN PII is processed THEN the system SHALL encrypt all sensitive data before storage
5. WHEN monitoring overhead occurs THEN the system SHALL limit tracing impact through sampling
